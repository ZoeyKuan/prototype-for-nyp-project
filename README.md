# intro to prototype-for-nyp-project
### description of prototype
- these were made to show the effectiveness of our hypothetical and imaginary app that was made to help students fall asleep efficiently.
### purpose of app / goal of our prototype
- the purpose of the app is to help students fall asleep efficiently
  - by providing ease of access to freelancer therapists as the app itself has little funding due to being hosted and created by students.
  - by launching this prototype, we hope that our end users understand the concept of what we are trying to sell and can see what is the value of our concept

# reasons for using this medium
### 1. presentability
- we are going to present our prototype on the projector as such, having adobe xd prototype means we need to either record how to use the prototype or stream it on the projector while having lag.
### 2. ease of editability and efficient production
- **editability:** we can edit the code that will change for a few pages all at once which makes editting far easier and less tedious than changing all the pages in adobe xd, one by one
- **code reusability:** it was easier to code and easier to manage the routing by using only the anchor html. some of the pages were completely reliant on javascript to generate its content which removes the hassle of creating each item by dragging and clicking
- **speedy content creation:** typing is faster than moving the mouse and typing the words. this duration is further shorten when i can reuse code snippets or use available codes to create our prototype, thus faster production of pages
> took >2hrs to create all of the pages and making it semi-functional

> only con is that making it pretty would take more time to create the assets, as such is the same for using adobe xd
